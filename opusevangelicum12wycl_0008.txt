followed God's law3 and the Church in the Apostles' time was at
its best, because it was ordered in all things according to1 Holy
Writ. The Sermon on the Mount alone, even without the rest of
the Bible, is a law sufficient to govern the world.² At present, of
course, men do not live according to God's law, as they did in the
time of the Apostles, The hierarchy is tainted with every kind of
evil3 and if prelates have not now so much power as the disciples
formerly had (Cap. XXVII-XXIX), it is because in our days the
prelates tear God’s law to pieceS.3 They do not teach or convert
the people with the same efficacy as the Apostles did.4 Thus we
must go back to the Bible, the only true source of good secular and
ecclesiasticalrule. Every truth, and the confutation of every error, are
to be found in the ssib1e; it is therefore necessary that all should
know the Bible,5 for it alone contains truth. Whether you be the
legist (legista) of the Pope, of the Emperor, of a kingdom or a
province, your laW, to have any worth at all, must be found in

how the Christian, whether a priest or a layman, ought to regulate
his life. There is not a single doctrine of the Church that he does
not either discuss at length, as for instance, that of the Eucharist, or
mention by the way, as that of auricular confession3 he also examines
the ethical system of the Church. ssut what he specially attacks
with passionate warmth, is the Church government as it was in his
dayS. He points out the contrast between the then existing and the
primitive Church. From the Pope, to whom he seldom gives any
