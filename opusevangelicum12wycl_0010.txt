VI INTRODUCTION.

correctly made. No such mistakes as in A are to be found in Β, and
careful corrections are numerous in the latter. As both codices have
a good many identical mistakes -— corrected more frequently in Β, and
less so in A ——· and specially as the omissions in A are the same as
those in Β (mostly corrected in the latter, and very seldom in the
former MS.), it is probable that both A and Β were copied from
the same manuscript. That neither was directly transcribed from
the other, may be more or less perfectly demonstrated in several
places. The text ofss is not only more correct; it is also more com·
plete3 in A, Ch, 57 of Book III (a rather long chapter) is missing.
The order of the chapters is somewhat different in the two MSS.
Certain chapters do not end at the same place in A and in Β. Β
lacks many marginal notes that are to be found in A, affording spe-
cial facilities for reference; Β goes no farther than giving marginal
corrections of the text. The four books begin respectively on pp. 3,
loo, 195 and 313, with illuminatedinitia153 each chapter commences
with blue initials ornamented with red arabesques. B has an exten-
sive index to the ‘Opus Evangelicum’‚ which, as it does not suffice
for the use of the book, I have not included in this edition.

The principles followed in this edition are the same as those
of the former works. Ι feel it to be my duty to offer my thanks to
those who have helped me in editing this volume: Dr. Furnivall,
Mr. F. D. Matthew — who has carefully read all the sheets and written
the side-notes - and Dr. Buddensieg.
