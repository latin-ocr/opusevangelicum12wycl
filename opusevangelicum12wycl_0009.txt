INTRODUCTION. V

other name than ‘Antichrist³, down to the very lowest ecclesiastical
official, every degree of the hierarchy is very sharply criticized by
him. The third book of the <Opus Evangelicum³ is so specially cha-
racterized in this way that it has received another name, appro-
priate to its virulence: ‘De Anticlzristo².

As my intention is, to give an account of the contents of this
work only in the introduction to the second volume, Ι will here
say but a few words about its date and the MS. transmission. It
is known that Wyclif died soon after having written this work3 a fact
to which ‘the copyist evidently alludes:

Autoris vita
Finitur et hoc opus ita.

The date, besides, is indicated as clearly as can possibly be
desired‚ in the XXXIVtll Ch. of the third book: Cum iam sit annus
millesimus trecentesimus octogesimus quartus . . .

The ‘Opus Evangelicum³ exists in two MSS: Β. 16, 2 of Tri-
nity College, Cambridge, and C. 1, 23, Trinity College, Dublin.
Both have been described in the introduction to the eSermones’,
vol. I (pp. XXXV—XXXVII) and ‘De Ecclesia³ pp. XXII—XXIV).

In the Cambridge MS. (Β 16, 2, or A) the ‘Opus Evangelicum³
begins on f. 353³ and ends on f. 43701. The first book comes to a
close on f. 379¹), the second on 40412, the third on 432³, and the
fourth on 437³. In the pagination the number 488 alone is wanting,
without any lacuna in the text. The handwriting and other externals
are exactly similar to the <Sermones³. At the top of each page stands
the number of the book: at the upper corner, at the very edge of
the page, are the words: De Sermone Domini in Monte. There are
also short marginal notes, numbers, and the following names: Chry-
sostomus‚ Augustinus, Johannes, and (in the third book) Jeronymus.

The copyist was obviously thinking of the Trialogus. He sup-
posed that -Wyclif intended to give the present work the form of a
trialogue, as Augustin, Chrysostom‚ and John (Wyclif) are made
to speak alternately.

In Cod. Dub. C 1, 23 (or B), the ‘Opus Evangelicum’ com-
mences on page 3 and ends on page 332. But I must mention a
considerable mistake in the pagination. After p. 290, comes
p. 301, without any gap in the text. The transcription is very
